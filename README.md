# Light Alarm Clock
> By Jerin Andrews

## Introduction
The idea for this project came to me while I was in India and I was struggling to adjust to my sleep schedule. Although setting normal alarms work, they have very negative impacts on your mind over time, so it is usually recommended to wake up to light. To do this I developed a program along with a circuit on a smaller scale that detects the light level in a room and flashes a light to wake you up instead of a loud alarm.

### Implemented Using:
+ [C++](https://devdocs.io/cpp/)
+ [Arduino](https://docs.arduino.cc/)
